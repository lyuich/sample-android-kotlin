## Memo

### Why integrate both of ktlint and detekt?

I think, 2 tools check different points.

- `ktlint` focus code style. (e.g. position of whitespace, naming rule.)
- `detekt` focus code smell. (e.g. condition is too complex, equals is implemented by hashCode is not.)

### Why configure ktlint and detekt in build.gradle directly?

We have [monstar-lab/gradle-android-ci-check](https://github.com/monstar-lab/gradle-android-ci-check).  
We need to improve that for kotlin setting.

But, currently, ktlint and detekt is developing very rapidly.  
So some interfaces may be changes.  
So now, configure in build.gradle directly.

(In the future, we need improve `monstar-lab/gradle-android-ci-check`.)

## Customize

This repository is targeting for very simple project.

But in real world, we need to work for complex project.

We have some advice for customizing configuration in [Wiki](https://github.com/noboru-i/sample-android-kotlin/wiki).
Please refer to it.
